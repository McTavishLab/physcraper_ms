\begin{abstract}
\parttitle{Background}
Phylogenies are a key part of research in many areas of biology. Tools that automate
some parts of the process of phylogenetic reconstruction, mainly molecular character matrix assembly,
have been developed for the advantage of both specialists in the field of phylogenetics and non-specialists.
However, interpretation of results, comparison with previously available phylogenetic
hypotheses, and selection of one phylogeny for downstream analyses and discussion still impose difficulties
to one that is not a specialist either on phylogenetic methods or on a particular group of study.

\parttitle{Results}
Physcraper is a command-line Python program that automates the update of published
phylogenies by adding public DNA sequences to underlying alignments of previously
published phylogenies. It also provides a framework for straightforward comparison
of published phylogenies with their updated versions, by leveraging upon tools from
the Open Tree of Life project to link taxonomic information across databases.

Physcraper can be used by the nonspecialist, as a tool to generate phylogenetic
hypotheses based on publicly available expert phylogenetic knowledge.
Phylogeneticists and taxonomic group specialists will find it useful as a tool
to facilitate molecular dataset gathering and comparison
of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (topologies).

\parttitle{Conclusions}
The Physcraper workflow demonstrates the benefits of doing open science for
phylogenetics, encouraging researchers to strive for better sharing practices.
Physcraper can be used with any OS and is released under an open-source license.
Detailed instructions for installation and
use are available at [https://physcraper.readthedocs](https://physcraper.readthedocs.io).

In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
%
\[
E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]=
\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp (\lambda_1)\,du .
\]
%
If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqexpmuts}
\begin{aligned}[b]
&      E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr]\\
&\quad      = \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,xjon,marg,schn,koha,issnic}).
