\item
  Phylogenies are a key part of research in many areas of biology. Tools that automatize
  some parts of the process of phylogenetic reconstruction, mainly molecular character matrix assembly,
  have been developed for the advantage of both specialists in the field of phylogenetics and nonspecialists.
  However, interpretation of results, comparison with previously available phylogenetic
  hypotheses, and choosing of one phylogeny for downstream analyses and discussion still impose difficulties
  to one that is not a specialist either on phylogenetic methods or on a particular group of study.
\item
  Physcraper is an open‚Äêsource, command-line Python program that automatizes the update of published
  phylogenies by enriching underlying gene alignments with public DNA sequence data, and linking taxonomic information across databases.
  This provides a framework for comparison of published phylogenies with their updated versions, by using the conflict Application Programming Interface (API) function of the Open Tree of Life project.
\item
  Physcraper can be used by the nonspecialist, as a tool to generate phylogenetic
  hypotheses based on already available expert phylogenetic knowledge.
  Phylogeneticists and group specialists will find it useful as a tool to facilitate molecular dataset gathering and comparison
  of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (topologies).
\item
  We hope that the Physcraper workflow demonstrates the benefits of doing open science for phylogenetics, encouraging more researchers to strive for better sharing practices. Physcraper can be used with any OS and is released under an open source license. Detailed instructions for installation and
  use are available at \href{https://physcraper.readthedocs.io/en/tutorial/index.html}{https://physcraper.readthedocs}.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Phylogenetic estimates of evolutionary relationships capture the shared history of living organisms, and provide key context for all our biological observations.
Public biological databases constitute an amazing resource for evolutionary estimation, but a large portion of molecular data publicly available has never been incorporated into any phylogenetic estimate.

GenBank, the USA National Center for Biodiversity Information (NCBI) molecular database, release number 159 (April 15, 2007) hosted 72 million DNA sequences that were gauged to have the potential to resolve phylogenetic relationships of most of its 241 000 distinct taxa (about 98.05\% of taxa in the NCBI taxonomy release 159; Sanderson \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-sanderson2008phylota}{2008}).
Currently, estimates of phylogenetic relationships are publicly available for about 100 000 taxa only (Piel \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-piel2009treebase}{2009}; Hinchliff \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-hinchliff2015synthesis}{2015}; OpenTreeOfLife \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-opentreeoflife2019synth}{2019}), representing less than half of the taxonomic diversity with phylogenetically informative sequence data available in GenBank more than a decade ago.

The discrepancy between molecular data availability and phylogenetic estimates can be partially explained by the many phylogenies that are generated and published and not shared publicly in an accesible way (Drew \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-drew2013lost}{2013}; Magee \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-magee2014dawn}{2014}; McTavish \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-mctavish2018bioessay}{2017}). However, there is also a lag between the amount of new DNA data generated and the analysis of these data in a phylogenetic context.

We address this gap by extending existing phylogenetic estimates with publicly available sequence data. By using a starting tree and single locus alignment, Physcraper, takes advantage of existing research, and extends trees using loci that taxon specialists have assessed and deemed appropriate for the phylogenetic scope.
The sequences added in the search are limited to a user specified taxon or monophyletic group, or within the taxonomic scope of the in-group of the starting tree.
These automated trees can provide a quick inference of potential relationships, of problems in the taxonomic assignments of sequences, and flag areas of potential systematic interest.

Physcraper leverages public phylogenetic data stored in Open Tree of Life and in TreeBase.
The Open Tree of Life (OpenTree from now on \url{https://opentreeoflife.github.io/}) is a project that unites phylogenetic inferences and taxonomy to provide a synthetic estimate of species relationships across the entire tree of life.
OpenTree aims to construct a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data.
This ``synthetic'' tree comprises 2.3 million tips, of which around 90,000 of those taxa are represented by phylogenetic estimates - the rest are placed in the tree based on their taxonomic names.

The Open Tree of Life data store, the \href{https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/17/2794/183373}{Phylesystem}, contains more than 4,500 phylogenetic trees from published studies.
The tips in these trees are mapped to a unified taxonomy, which makes these data searchable in a phylogenetically explicit way.
This provides a resource for finding existing estimates of phylogenetic relationships,
and assessing which regions of the tree of life are lacking available phylogenetic estimates.

By linking molecular data, available from databases such as the GenBank (Benson \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-benson2000genbank}{2000}; Wheeler \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-wheeler2000database}{2000}), to alignments and phylogenies, available in
the TreeBASE repository (Piel \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-piel2009treebase}{2009}) and OpenTree's Phylesystem, we can place new biological data in an evolutionary context.

ARGUMENT - GENES ARE STILL USEFUL IN THE GENOMICS ERA, AND HERE'S WHY:
GENOMIC MARKERS SUCH AS RADSEQ, SNP, MISCROSATS AND UCES - ARE HOMOLOGY HYPOTHESIS THE SAME ON THESE MARKERS THAN FOR PROTEIN CODING AND NON CODING LOCI?
WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF USING GENE ALIGNMENTS ONLY AND NOT GENOMIC MARKERS?
Martha: Genomic data is not available for a large number of taxa.
While the focus on single locus and gene sequence alignments could appear backwards-looking, in the age of genomics, single locus data has a lot to offer phylogenetics.
One major challenge of inferring phylogenies from genome scale data is inference of homology, and acquiring homologous data across divergent species.
Different research questions call for on different approaches to genomic sequencing, from whole genomes, to transcriptomes, to RadSeq, SNP, mirosats and UCE's.
This variety of approaches results in non-overlapping data sets across taxa.
Even when the same sequencing approach is applied, such as RadSeq, phylogenetic distance can cause allelic dropout at deeper divergences (Eaton \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-eaton2016misconceptions}{2016})
In contrast, single locus sequencing generates homologous data across large phylogenetic scales.

Indeed, some systematics support a classic phylogenetics approach (few markers thoughtfully curated) over the genomics approach (a massive amount of DNA markers that will overcome potential errors in the alignment coming from a lack of human curation).
Species tree reconstructions from multi-gene data sets taking into account the multispecies coalescent model are considered the gold standard for inferring species relationships {[}Song \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-song2012resolving}{2012}); ROJAS ET AL. bats paper, take citations from there{]}.
It has also been suggested that manual curation of locus alignments produces better phylogenetic reconstructions and this has been demonstrated for genomic alignments (Fragoso-Mart√≠nez \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-fragoso2017pilot}{2017}).

A way to incorporate the best of two worlds (massive amounts of newly released molecular data AND fine-grained curation from human experts) is to rely on published manually curated homology hypotheses as ``jump-start'' alignments (Morrison \protect\hyperlink{ref-morrison2006multiple}{2006}). This expert-curated alignments can be continuously enriched and updated by incorporating newly released data from public molecular databases.

In leveraging existing homology statements in the form of alignments, this approach differs from existing approaches that automatize the assembly of DNA alignments from the GenBank database for phylogenetic reconstruction (``phylogenetic pipelines'') such as PHYLOTA (Sanderson \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-sanderson2008phylota}{2008}), PHLAWD (Smith \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-smith2009mega}{2009}), and SUPERSMART (Antonelli \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-antonelli2017toward}{2017}).
Physcraper shares a similar conceptual framework to Pumper (Izquierdo-Carrasco \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-izquierdo2014pumper}{2014}), but that software is not currently supported or developed (\emph{or runnable at all honestly\ldots{}})

Data input availability:
As of April 2014, the TreeBASE repository hosted about 8 200 curated alignments, providing information on evolutionary relationships of around 100 000 distinct taxa \href{https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html\#:~:text=TreeBASE\%20is\%20produced\%20and\%20governed,mapped\%20to\%20104\%2C593\%20distinct\%20taxa.}{(see TreeBASE's website about)}.
This database provides an untapped source of valuable expert knowledge with the potential to update phylogenetic relationships in several different regions of the tree of life.

The Phylesystem (OpenTree's datastore) (McTavish \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-mctavish2015phylesystem}{2015}) automatically incorporates phylogenies from TreeBASE, and saves metadata linking the original tree to its corresponding alignment repository in TreeBASE. If there are multiple alignments, TreeBASE does not always indicate how they were used to generate the tree. This provides a loose means of linking the tree with the exact alignment that generated it.

Often, linking data in an original alignment with its corresponding phylogeny has to be done by a human curator.
Moreover, different data repositories follow different systems for taxon and study identification, posing a real challenge to automatically link data from across databases that belong to the same taxon and study.
OpenTree's metadata system incorporates taxon identifiers from a variety of taxonomies and repositories, including the NCBI taxonomy, GBIF, etc., MORE EXAMPLES OF DATABASES providing a way to automatically link data from different databases.

Physcraper is a Python encoded pipeline designed to update previously known phylogenetic relationships in a continuous manner, by connecting phylogenies stored in the OpenTree Phylesystem with alignments from TreeBASE and newly released DNA data from GenBank, by using the OpenTree metadata system to connect independent databases through their unique taxon identifiers, automatizing taxonomic name matching across them.
By design, this approach focuses on data interoperability. By automating taxonomic name matching across NCBI, OpenTree, GBIF and virtually any biological database, users can perform downstream analyses straightforwardly.
For example, it automatizes and standardizes comparison of phylogenetic hypotheses with currently known relationships from the synthetic Open Tree of Life, the Open Tree of Life taxonomy tree and any phylogeny that is stored in the
Phylesystem.

We propose Physcraper as a tool to make data connections across biological databases in a phylogenetic context for the advantage of phylogenetics and comparative biology, as well as an effort towards establishing fully reproducible workflows in phylogenetics.

\hypertarget{the-inputs-a-tree-and-an-alignment}{%
\subsection{The inputs: a tree and an alignment}\label{the-inputs-a-tree-and-an-alignment}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In order to take advantage of the OpenTree tools, it is reccommended that the input tree is either stored in the
  OpenTree \href{https://github.com/opentreeoflife/phylesystem}{Phylesystem}, or submitted via OpenTree's curator \href{https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator}{application} (McTavish \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-mctavish2015phylesystem}{2015}). If the user is not ready to make the input tree public, tree tip labels must be standardized to the unified OpenTree taxonomy using the bulk Taxonomic Name Resolution Service \href{https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator/tnrs/}{TNRS} tool \emph{Is there a tnrs bulk citation?}. If taxonomic names can't be standardized, they will be excluded for further analysis.
  Adding the tree to OpenTree's Phylesystem is recommended because it saves a set of user defined characteristics
  that are essential for automatizing the phylogeny updating process. The most relevant of these is the standardization of taxonomic names and the definition of ingroup and outgroup taxa, allowing to automatically set the root for the updated tree on the final steps of the pipeline. Currently, only trees connected to a published study can be stored in the Phylesystem.
  Users can choose from among the 1216 published trees supporting the resolved nodes of the synthetic tree in the OpenTree website (\href{https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/synthesis-release/v12.3}{See OpenTree's website about}). \emph{MK suggests that WE SHOULD ACTUALLY SAY HERE HOW MANY OPENTREE TREES HAVE ALIGNMENT DATA FROM TREEBASE, I think it's a good idea}
\item
  The input alignment should be a single locus alignment that was used to generate the tree. Alignments are often stored in a public repository such as TreeBase (Piel \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-piel2009treebase}{2009}; Vos \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-vos2012nexml}{2012}),
  DRYAD (\href{http://datadryad.org/}{www.datadryad.org}), or the journal where the tree was originally published.
  If the alignment is stored in TreeBase, Physcraper downloads it directly,
  either from the TreeBASE website (\href{https://treebase.org/}{www.treebase.org})
  or through the TreeBASE GitHub repository (SuperTreeBASE; \href{https://github.com/TreeBASE/supertreebase}{github.com/TreeBASE/supertreebase}).
  If the alignment is on another repository, or constitutes personal data, a path to a local copy of the alignment has to be provided.
\item
  When dealing with single locus alignments, it is common for alignments to have less taxa than the tree, simply because a single molecular marker usually does not cover all the taxa included in the phylogenetic analysis. Hence, a pruning step to reconcile taxon presence in the tree and alignment is performed. This verifies that all taxon names on the tips of the tree are in the DNA character matrix and vice versa. Technically, just one taxon name (and its coresonding sequence in the alignment) is needed to continue the algorithm. See next section. \emph{MK mentioned that nothing shoul be dropped here bc the name standardization should have matched everything, so I explained a bit more what this step is. It is not an unmatched taxa pruning but more of an absent taxa pruning. Also, taxa that are not matched should be dropped before right?}
\item
  A summary ``csv'' file with the results from the taxon name standardization and pruning is produced for the user.
\item
  The standardized and pruned tree and alignment (checked tree and alignment from now on) are written down as ``newick'' and ``fasta'' respectively in the ``inputs'' folder to be used in the following steps.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{dna-sequence-search-and-filtering}{%
\subsection{DNA sequence search and filtering}\label{dna-sequence-search-and-filtering}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Physcraper uses the GenBank DNA database as source to search for new sequences. The DNA sequence search can be performed on the GenBank remote database or in a GenBank local database set up by the user, which can speed up the search process. Detailed instructions to setup a local database are provided on Physcraper's software documentation.
\item
  The next step is to identify a ``search taxon'' to constrain the sequence search on the GenBank database within that taxonomic group.
  The search taxon can be chosen by the user from the NCBI taxonomy. If none is provided, then the search taxon is automatically set as the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of the
  matched taxa belonging to the ingroup in the OpenTree synthetic tree, that is also a named clade in the NCBI taxonomy.
  This is known in the OpenTree as the Most Recent Common
  Ancestral Taxon (MRCAT; also referred as the Least Inclusive Common Ancestral taxon - LICA) \emph{I looked for a citation but it seems that it is a concept used on the open tree of life API wikis only}.
  The MRCAT can be different from the phylogenetic MRCA when the latter is an unnamed clade in the reference taxonomy.
  To identify the MRCAT of a group of taxon names, we use the OpenTree \href{https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/germinator/wiki/Taxonomy-API-v3\#mrca}{taxonomic tool v3} (Rees \& Cranston \protect\hyperlink{ref-rees2017automated}{2017}).

  Users can provide a search taxon that is either a more or a less inclusive
  clade relative to the ingroup of the original phylogeny. If the search taxon is more inclusive, the sequence search will be performed outside the MRCAT of the matched taxa, e.g., including all taxa within
  the family or the order that the ingroup belongs to. If the search taxon is a less inclusive clade, the users can focus on enriching a particular clade/region within the ingroup of the phylogeny.
\item
  The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, BLAST (Altschul \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-altschul1990basic}{1990}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-altschul1997gapped}{1997}) is used to identify
  similarity between DNA sequences within the search taxon in a nucleotide
  database, and the sequences on the checked alignment.
  The \texttt{blastn} function from the BLAST command line tools (Camacho \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-camacho2009blast}{2009}) is used for local database sequence searches.
  For remote database searches, we modified the BioPython (Cock \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-cock2009biopython}{2009}) BLAST function from the \href{https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW-module.html}{NCBIWWW module} to accept an alternative BLAST address (URL). This is useful when a user has no access to the computer capacity needed to setup a local database, and a local blast database can be set up on a remote machine to BLAST avoiding NCBI's required wait times, which slow down the searches markedly.
  \emph{MK suggest explaining here what the ncbi waiting times are, but I don;t think it's needed, what do you think?}
\item
  A constrained BLAST search is performed, in which each sequence
  in the alignment is BLASTed once against all database DNA sequences belonging to the search
  taxon. All results from each BLAST run are written down, and sequences above the e-value (default to 0.00001) are saved
  along with their corresponding identification numbers, i.e., their GenBank accession numbers, which will be used later to get the whole sequence from the GenBank database in a dedicated library within the ``physcraper'' folder, allowing for secondary analyses to run significantly faster.
\item
  BLAST result sequences will be discarded if they fall outside a default minimum and maximum length of 80\% and 120\%, respectively, of the average length (gaps dropped) of sequences in the checked alignment.
  This filtering guarantees the exclusion of whole genome sequences.
\item
  All accepted sequences up to this point are assigned an internal identifier, and are further filtered.
\item
  New sequences that are identical to existing sequences, or to subsets of an existing sequence are discarded, unless they represent a different taxon than the existing sequence \emph{MK mentioned it was unclear to her if this was an NCBI or OTT taxon. I think it is the unified taxonomy, hence an OTT taxon? I think it doesn;t harm to be super explicit about it}.
  Longer sequences belonging to the
  same taxon as the original sequence will be considered further for analysis.
\item
  Among the filtered sequences, there are often several representatives per taxon.
  Although it can be useful to keep some of them, for example, to investigate monophyly
  within species, there can be hundreds of exemplar sequences per taxon for some markers.
  To control the number of sequences per taxon in downstream analyses,
  5 sequences per taxon are chosen at random. This number is set by default but can be modified by the user.
\item
  All BLAST and filtering parameters can be customized by the user.
\item
  Reverse, complement, and reverse-complement BLAST result sequences are identified and translated using BioPython internal functions (Cock \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-cock2009biopython}{2009}).
\item
  Iterative cycles of sequence similarity search can be performed, by blasting the newly found sequences until no new sequences are found. By default only one BLAST search cycle is performed in which only sequences in the processed original alignment are blasted.
\item
  To speed up future runs, accepted sequences are downloaded in full, and stored in a local directory (default to ``physcraper/taxonomy'' folder) that is globally accessible to users.
\item
  New seqeunces that pass all filtering steps are added to the ``csv'' taxon summary file.
\item
  A ``fasta'' file containing all new filtered and processed sequences resulting from the BLAST search is generated for the user, and is used as an input for alignment.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{new-dna-sequence-alignment}{%
\subsection{New DNA sequence alignment}\label{new-dna-sequence-alignment}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Physcraper uses the software MUSCLE (Edgar \protect\hyperlink{ref-edgar2004muscle}{2004}) to perform DNA sequence alignments. Instructions on how to install all software dependencies used by Physcraper are provided in the documentation.
\item
  The process to align new sequences consists of two steps. First, all new sequences are aligned using the default MUSCLE options.
\item
  Second, a MUSCLE profile alignment is performed, in which the original alignment
  is used as a template to align the new sequences. This ensures that the final alignment
  follows the homology criteria established by the original alignment.
\item
  The final alignment is not further processed by Physcraper. It is recommended that the alignment is checked by the user, by eye followed by manual refinement, or using a tool for alignment processing EXAMPLES OF SUCH TOOLS.
\item
  While curating the alignment is a critical step, it is not a reproducible one. The main reason for its lack of reproducibility might be that it is hard to track changes made on the alignment. A form of version control, to register the differences between the alignment that was produced by the siftware and the manually curated aligment will be ideal. Versioning alignments and adding them to a global database is a next step for us!
\item
  Users may also use Physcraper to gather matched sequences only, and apply their own preferred alignment and phylogenetic inference methods.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tree-reconstruction-and-comparison}{%
\subsection{Tree reconstruction and comparison}\label{tree-reconstruction-and-comparison}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A Maximum Likelihood (ML) gene tree is reconstructed for each alignment provided, using the software RAxML (Stamatakis \protect\hyperlink{ref-stamatakis2014raxml}{2014}) with default settings, such as a GTRCAT model of molecular evolution and 100 bootstrap replicates with the default algorithm. Currently only the number of bootsrap replicates can be specified by the user.
\item
  By default, the original tree is used as a starting tree for the ML searches. Alternatively, users can set the original tree as a full topological constraint, or ignore it completely for the searches.
\item
  Bootstrap results are summarized with the SumTrees module of DendroPy (current version 4.4.0; Sukumaran \& Holder \protect\hyperlink{ref-sukumaran2010dendropy}{2010}).
\item
  Physcraper's final result is an updated phylogenetic hypothesis for each of the genes provided in the input alignment.
\item
  Tips on all trees generated by Physcraper are defined by a taxon ``name space'', which captures the NCBI accession information, as well as the taxon identifiers, allowing the user to perform comparisons and conflict analyses.
\item
  Two ways to compare the updated tree with the original tree are implemented in Physcraper. First, Robinson Foulds weighted and unweighted metrics are estimated using Dendropy functions (Sukumaran \& Holder \protect\hyperlink{ref-sukumaran2010dendropy}{2010}).
\item
  Second, a conflict analysis is performed. This is a node by node comparison between the the synthetic OpenTree and the original and updated tree individually. This is performed with OpenTree's conflict Application Programming Interface (Redelings \& Holder \protect\hyperlink{ref-redelings2017supertree}{2017}).
\item
  For the conflict analysis to be meaningful, the root of the tree needs to be accurately defined.
\item
  A suggested default rooting based on OpenTree's taxonomy is implemented for now. This approach uses the taxon labels for all the tips in the updated tree, pulls an inferred subtree from OpenTree's taxonomy and then applies the same rooting to the inferred updated tree. However, if the updated tree changes expectations from taxonomy, the root may no longer be appropriate. Automatic identification of a phylogenetic tree root is indeed a difficult problem that has not been solved yet. The best way right now is for users to define outgroup directly on the updated tree, so trees are accurately rooted. \emph{It would be a nice addiion to have users give the output of the input tree as an argument at some point, or maybe we could add a super outgroup at random based on the search taxon}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{examples}{%

We will illustrate the utility of Physcraper in here with two use-case scenarios. One in which the user is interested in a particular group. Another one in which the user is interested in a particular phylogeny.
A tutorial as well as illustrated examples of commands for every step needed to perform a Physcraper analysis are available elsewhere.

A review of literature (google scholar search for ``ilex phylogeny'') reveals that there are several published phylogenetic trees showing relationships within the hollies (CU√âNOUD \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-cuenoud2000molecular}{2000}; Setoguchi \& Watanabe \protect\hyperlink{ref-setoguchi2000intersectional}{2000}; Selbach-Schnadelbach \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-selbach2009new}{2009}; Manen \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-manen2010history}{2010}), but only two have their data available publicly (Gottlieb \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-gottlieb2005molecular}{2005}; Yao \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-yao2020phylogeny}{2020}).
Gottlieb \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gottlieb2005molecular}{2005}) made tree and alignment data available in TreeBASE. The tree sampling 48 species was integrated to the OpenTree Phylesystem and is part of OpenTree's synthetic tree.
The most recent \emph{Ilex} tree from Yao \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-yao2020phylogeny}{2020}) has been made available in the OpenTree Phylesystem and in the DRYAD repository. It is the best sampled yet for the genus, with 200 species. However, it has not been added to OpenTree's synthtetic tree yet.
This makes it a perfect case to test the basic functionalities of Physcraper: we know that the sequences of the most recently published tree have been made available on the GenBank database. Hence, we expect that updating the oldest tree should at least contain the same species sampled in the largest tree.

\subsection{The Malvaceae}\label{the-malvaceae}}

A postdoc started working with a new reserach group. They are interested in solving relationships among lineages of the Malvaceae, a family of flowering plants with almost 6 000 known species, containing the relatives of cacao, cotton, durian and okra.
A review of the literature shows them that there are many phylogenetic trees encompassing some of the linegaes in the group. However, the head of the research group wants to use a particular marker they believe to be the best one to be able to solve the relationships in the group. They have been working on the alignment for a long time and they want to incorporate new data into the hypothesis of homology that they have been curating and that they trust.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Data repositories hold even more information than meets the eye.
Besides the actual data, they are rich sources of metadata that can be used for the advantage of all areas of biology as well as the advancement of scientific policy and applications.

COMPARE WITH PERFORMANCE OF OTHER PIPELINES FOR SEQUENCE SCRAPING
WHY WE DID NOT MAKE A BENCHMARK COMPARISON

Many pipelines are making use of DNA data repositories in different ways.
Most of them focus on efficient ways to mine the data -- getting the most homologs.
Some focus on accurate ways of mining the data -- getting real and clean homologs.
Others focus on refining the alignment.
Most focus on generating full trees \emph{de novo}, mainly for regions of the Tree of
Life that have no phylogenetic assessment yet in published studies, but also for
regions that have already been studied and which have phylogenetic data.
However, expert phylogenetic knowledge is also an important source of data in public
and open repositories that is not being used to its full potential.

All these tools are key efforts for advancing towards reproducibility in phylogenetics,
a field that has relied on processes which are somewhat artisanal.
Here, we highlight the potential of taking advantage of this careful curation work in previous phylogenetic estimates. By taking sources of information available from data repositories and present a method to link data from different repositories, while leveraging the knowledge and intuition of the expert
community to build up our phylogenetic knowledge, we can use not only data accumulated in
molecular data repositories, but phylogenetic knowledge accumulated in phylogenetic tree repositories.

While not generating full phylogenies \emph{de novo}, Physcraper is still capable of generating new phylogenetic knowledge.
Moreover, it can combine phylogenies with data from repositories other than molecular data. For example geographic locations (using GBIF ids), fossils (using PBDB ids), etc. \emph{from Robert: I think you can sell the program more here. Why is it better than the other methods? You mentioned in lab meeting that its difficult to run other programs, talk about that here, talk about the speed and other advantages}

Physcraper has the potential to be applied for the advantage of the field to rapidly \emph{HOW FAST IS ``RAPID'' mention it in results and then here again}
place newly discovered species phylogenetically (Webb \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-webb2010biodiversity}{2010}),
obtain trees for ecophylogenetic studies (Helmus \& Ives \protect\hyperlink{ref-helmus2012phylogenetic}{2012}),
help to systematize molecular databases, i.e., curate taxonomic assignations (San Mauro \& Agorreta \protect\hyperlink{ref-san2010molecular}{2010}),
and rapidly generate custom species trees for downstream analyses (Stoltzfus \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-stoltzfus2013phylotastic}{2013}).
